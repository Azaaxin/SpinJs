# SpincoreJs
Tool for my own use to speed up the process of making websites.

##Spin CommandList

| $pin(selector).getText(url, attribute); | Grabs content from url, super basic ajax |

## What can it do?
It can't do much at the moment, just printing out AJAX in specific div's. More functions will be added!

## What is the difference between Spincore and Spin?
With Spin do you work with the selector, with Spincore you don't need that.

## Can I use this?
Yes of course you can do. But make sure you let people know that I'm the author by not removing comments in the library.
