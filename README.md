# SpincoreJs
Tool for my own use to speed up the process of making websites.

## CommandList

| Syntax | Description |
|--|--|
| $pin(selector).attr(name, value); | Hides selected object |
| $pin(selector).hide(); | Hides selected object |
| $pin(selector).getText(url, attribute); | Grabs the text from url, super basic ajax |
| $pin(selector).getAjax(url, attribute, search); | Ajax call that can search through JSON for the right values |

## What can it do?
It can't do much at the moment, just printing out AJAX in specific div's. More functions will be added!

## Can I use this?
Yes of course you can do. But make sure you let people know that I'm the author by not removing comments in the library.
